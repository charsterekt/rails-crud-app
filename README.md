# Ruby on Rails

This is a simple Ruby on Rails CRUD based app made for educational purposes. It has been styled with some minimal Bootstrap. In development, it uses an SQLite3 database. For production, this has been upgraded to a Postgres database. The app is very simple and has a lot of empty pages with some placeholders as the main part of the app is the CRUD friends list. Note, due to the recent Rails 7 integration with Turbo, `delete` and `destroy` operations aren't asking for confirmation dialogs as they are usually expected to. Additional user authentication and management has been added with the popular devise gem.
